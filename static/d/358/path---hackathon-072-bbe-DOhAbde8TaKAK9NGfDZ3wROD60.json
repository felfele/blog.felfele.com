This was a private, invite only event, we are still testing our initial concepts in our network. The event was held at a very friendly coworking office / atelier, Flux Workspace, Budapest. The participants were of mixed background, designers, engineers, market research, QA, etc. The goal was to bring in some fresh thoughts regarding a number of topics, which were the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>find new ways of sharing</li>\n<li>reinvent the timeline</li>\n<li>handle multiple identities</li>\n<li>explore content</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"./collage2.jpg\"></p>\n<p>After the Q&#x26;A and some debate, 3 teams were formed, and we have started to work on the ideas around 8 oâ€™clock. The brainstorming and the work lasted until 11pm, when we have gathered to show the results to each other.</p>\n<p><img src=\"./collage3.jpg\"></p>\n<p>The bad news is that most of the video documentation got lost ðŸ˜”</p>\n<p>The good news is that we have decided to use the results of all 3 projects ðŸ˜Š</p>\n<p>The first team to present took a really big challenge: how to handle multiple identities in a privacy conscious social app, taking into account the posting workflow.

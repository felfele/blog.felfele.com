This was a private, invite only event, we are still testing our initial concepts in our network. The event was held at a very friendly coworking office / atelier, Flux Workspace, Budapest. The participants were of mixed background, designers, engineers, market research, QA, etc. The goal was to bring in some fresh thoughts regarding a number of topics, which were the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;find new ways of sharing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;reinvent the timeline&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;handle multiple identities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;explore content&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the Q&amp;#x26;A and some debate, 3 teams were formed, and we have started to work on the ideas around 8 o’clock. The brainstorming and the work lasted until 11pm, when we have gathered to show the results to each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bad news is that most of the video documentation got lost 😔&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good news is that we have decided to use the results of all 3 projects 😊&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first team to present took a really big challenge: how to handle multiple identities in a privacy conscious social app, taking into account the posting workflow. Sketch file &lt;a href=&quot;https://sketch.cloud/s/jrvGm/all/page-1/artboard-2&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

          &quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
          
&lt;p&gt;The second team’s project was to reinvent the timeline, and spicing up the style as well. Check it out on &lt;a href=&quot;https://sketch.cloud/s/JJg0G/all/page-1/a4-copy-2&quot;&gt;sketch&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

          &quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
          
&lt;p&gt;The last team wanted to tackle the problem of news recommendation, which can be challenging on a new platform. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.figma.com/file/RxcHzdWqS9jjP1FNdovUMVj1/Social-App-Feed?node-id=0%3A1&quot;&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt; you can check out the wireframe.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;
          
&lt;p&gt;The energy was great throughout the evening, and we were happy with the results. Thanks again for everyone who participated, hopefully we will have some similar events in the future, we would be glad to see you again!&lt;/p&gt;

Consonantia, there live the blind texts. Separated they live in Bookmarksgrove
right at the coast of the Semantics, a large language ocean. A small river named
Duden flows by their place and supplies it with the necessary regelialia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;On deer horse aboard tritely yikes and much&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Big Oxmox advised her not to do so, because there were thousands of bad
Commas, wild Question Marks and devious Semikoli, but the Little Blind Text
didn’t listen. She packed her seven versalia, put her initial into the belt and
made herself on the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This however showed weasel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well uncritical so misled&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;this is very interesting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Goodness much until that fluid owl&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When she reached the first hills of the &lt;strong&gt;Italic Mountains&lt;/strong&gt;, she had a last
view back on the skyline of her hometown &lt;em&gt;Bookmarksgrove&lt;/em&gt;, the headline of
&lt;a href=&quot;http://google.com&quot;&gt;Alphabet Village&lt;/a&gt; and the subline of her own road, the Line
Lane. Pityful a rethoric question ran over her cheek, then she continued her
way. On her way she met a copy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Overlaid the jeepers uselessly much excluding&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But nothing the copy said could convince her and so it didn’t take long until a
few insidious Copy Writers ambushed her, made her drunk with
&lt;a href=&quot;http://google.com&quot;&gt;Longe and Parole&lt;/a&gt; and dragged her into their agency, where
they abused her for their projects again and again. And if she hasn’t been
rewritten, then they are still using her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Far far away, behind the word mountains, far from the countries Vokalia and
Consonantia, there live the blind texts. Separated they live in Bookmarksgrove
right at the coast of the Semantics, a large language ocean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a paradisematic country, in which roasted parts of sentences fly into your
mouth. Even the all-powerful Pointing has no control about the blind texts it is
an almost unorthographic life One day however a small line of blind text by the
name of Lorem Ipsum decided to leave for the far World of Grammar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;According a funnily until pre-set or arrogant well cheerful&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Big Oxmox advised her not to do so, because there were thousands of bad

&lt;p&gt;When she reached the first hills of the Italic Mountains, she had a last view
back on the skyline of her hometown Bookmarksgrove, the headline of Alphabet
Village and the subline of her own road, the Line Lane. Pityful a rethoric
question ran over her cheek, then she continued her way. On her way she met a
copy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The copy warned the Little Blind Text, that where it came from it would have
been rewritten a thousand times and everything that was left from its origin
would be the word “and” and the Little Blind Text should turn around and
return to its own, safe country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But nothing the copy said could convince her and so it didn’t take long until a

&lt;p&gt;Did you know that “despite its name, salted duck eggs can also be made from
chicken eggs, though the taste and texture will be somewhat different, and the
egg yolk will be less rich.”?

How exciting!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m sure I’ll write a lot more interesting things in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and here’s a great quote from this Wikipedia on
&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salted_duck_egg&quot;&gt;salted duck eggs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A salted duck egg is a Chinese preserved food product made by soaking duck
eggs in brine, or packing each egg in damp, salted charcoal. In Asian
supermarkets, these eggs are sometimes sold covered in a thick layer of salted
charcoal paste. The eggs may also be sold with the salted paste removed,
wrapped in plastic, and vacuum packed. From the salt curing process, the
salted duck eggs have a briny aroma, a gelatin-like egg white and a
firm-textured, round yolk that is bright orange-red in color.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
